# TickTickBoom Todos

_TickTickBoom Todos_ is a sleek and intuitive **task management web app** built with **React** and **Redux**. It helps users efficiently **add**, **track**, and **organize** their **daily tasks** with features such as **priority marking** and **completion** status. 

I built this Todo List app from scratch under the guidance of [Manoj Satishkumar](https://github.com/ManojSatishkumar) through his Udemy course [React, Redux & Material UI Workshop for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/share/104QlA3@vy3Ih7F-UW3jTOmX47aqf68XnXqUv_CaPryesrijwM5Du5yLeq_xC1H2Gn3v4UIAmw==/). This hands-on experience strengthened my understanding of **state management**, **UI components**, and **unit testing best practices** and ultimately enabled to me to become a better Web Developer.
